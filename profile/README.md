## 🦀 rustic - fast, encrypted and deduplicated backups

### 🙋‍♀️ Introduction

rustic is a backup tool that provides fast, encrypted, deduplicated backups.

It reads and writes the restic repo format described in the design document and can be used as a restic replacement in most cases.

It is implemented in Rust, a performant, memory-efficient, and reliable cross-platform systems programming language.

Hence rustic supports all major operating systems (Linux, MacOs, *BSD), with Windows support still being experimental.
